My first Alexa skill! 

I recently visited Washington, DC for the first time and seeing the Capitol building and other historic monuments had made me feel rather politically inspired. So I decided my first Alexa skill should help me relearn the political lessons of old and remind me what's in the US Constitution.

First, I read a simple tutorial and copied the source code from the following example.

Knowing that I wanted to write a skill focused on the US Constitution, I picked a solid reference for the source text.

<a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992" target="_blank">https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992</a>

Additionally, I wanted to include short descriptions (along with the short text) to succintly explain each amendment and article.
